/*
Given two integers num1 and num2, return the sum of the two integers.
 
Example 1:
Input: num1 = 12, num2 = 5
Output: 17
Explanation: num1 is 12, num2 is 5, and their sum is 12 + 5 = 17, so 17 is returned.

Constraints:
-100 <= num1, num2 <= 100
*/

var sum = function(num1, num2) {
    //create answer variable
    let answer;
    //set the answer variable equal to sum of both integers
    answer = num1 + num2;
    //return answer variable
    return answer;
};
