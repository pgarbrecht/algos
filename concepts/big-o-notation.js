/* There are often many ways to solve a problem. Big O is a system to measure efficiency of a code solution. More efficient code is usually better. But "better" can depend on the use case, and Big O can also help you measure trade-offs between different solutions (ie time vs space).

Big O uses numeric representations of how efficient the code is. Using n as the number of simple operations the computer has to perform in a solution, there are a few categories of solutions. They are:
